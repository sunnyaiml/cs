## üß† Microprocessors (8085)

### Block Diagram of 8085 Microprocessor

The *8085 Microprocessor* is a *5-register* machine that processes
data through its main components:
- *Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)*: Executes arithmetic and logical
operations.
- *Accumulator*: Holds data temporarily during operations.
- *Program Counter (PC)*: Holds the address of the next instruction.
- *Instruction Register (IR)*: Holds the current instruction.
- *Stack Pointer (SP)*: Points to the top of the stack in memory.

### Accumulator and Program Counter Functions

- *Accumulator*: Used to store intermediate results of arithmetic and
logical operations.
- *Program Counter*: Holds the address of the next instruction to be
executed, ensuring the sequential flow of the program.

### Microprocessor vs Microcontroller

- *Microprocessor*: Primarily used for processing tasks and requires
external components like memory and input/output devices to function.
- *Microcontroller*: A compact integrated circuit that includes a CPU,
memory (RAM/ROM), and peripherals, designed for embedded applications.

### Opcode and Operand

- *Opcode*: The part of an instruction that specifies the operation to
be performed (e.g., MOV, ADD).
- *Operand*: The data or memory address on which the operation is
performed (e.g., A, 5).

### Instruction Set & Programming of 8085

#### Types of Instructions in 8085

- *Data Transfer Instructions*: E.g., MOV A, B
- *Arithmetic Instructions*: E.g., ADD A, B
- *Logical Instructions*: E.g., AND A, B
- *Control Instructions*: E.g., NOP, HALT

#### Example: Add Two 8-bit Numbers

assembly
MVI A, 30H   ; Load 30H into Accumulator
MVI B, 40H   ; Load 40H into register B
ADD B        ; Add the contents of register B to Accumulator
HLT          ; Halt the program


#### CALL vs JUMP

- *CALL*: Used to call a subroutine, saves the return address on the
stack.
- *JUMP*: Unconditional jump to a specified address.

#### Key Terms

- *Machine Cycle*: A machine cycle is the time required to complete a
basic operation.
- *T-state*: A time unit representing the clock cycle.
- *Instruction Cycle*: A complete cycle for executing one instruction.

## üíª Intel X-86 Family

### Differences Between 8086 and 80286 Processors

- *8086*: A 16-bit processor with a 20-bit address bus, capable of
addressing 1MB of memory.
- *80286*: A 16-bit processor with a 24-bit address bus, capable of
addressing 16MB of memory, supports *protected mode*.

### Segmentation in X-86 Processors

Segmentation allows programs to be divided into logical sections (code,
data, stack), improving memory management and protection.

### Pipelining in X-86 Processors

Pipelining allows multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously
at different stages, improving CPU throughput and efficiency.

### Evolution of Intel Processors

 From the *8086* (early 16-bit processor) to the *Pentium series*
(which introduced *superscalar architecture, **MMX* instructions,
and *multimedia support*), Intel processors have significantly
increased performance and capabilities over time.

## üñ• Microcontrollers (8051)

### Features of the 8051 Microcontroller

- *8-bit CPU* with internal RAM (128 bytes) and ROM (4KB).
- *4 parallel I/O ports*.
- *Timers* and *interrupts* for real-time control.
- *On-chip serial communication*.

### Microprocessor vs Microcontroller

While a *microprocessor* focuses on processing power and requires
external components for a system, a *microcontroller* is
self-contained with integrated memory and peripherals for embedded
applications.

### 8051 Architecture

The *8051 microcontroller* includes:
- *CPU*: Executes instructions.
- *Program Memory*: Stores code.
- *Data Memory (RAM)*: Stores data.
- *Ports and I/O*: Interface with external devices.

### Applications of Microcontrollers

- *Embedded Systems: Used in devices like **home appliances*,
*automobiles, and **medical equipment* for specific control tasks.

## üåê Networking Technology

### OSI Model and Layers

The *OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)* model defines a seven-layer
framework for networking:
1. *Physical*: Data transmission via cables, switches.
2. *Data Link*: Error detection and correction.
3. *Network*: Routing and IP addressing.
4. *Transport*: End-to-end communication (TCP/UDP).
5. *Session*: Manages sessions between applications.
6. *Presentation*: Data translation, encryption.
7. *Application*: User interfaces and application protocols.

### TCP vs UDP

- *TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)*: Reliable, connection-oriented
protocol (e.g., for web traffic).
- *UDP (User Datagram Protocol)*: Unreliable, connectionless protocol
(e.g., for real-time streaming).

### Routers and Switches

- *Router*: Directs data between different networks based on IP
addresses.
- *Switch*: Forwards data within the same network based on MAC
addresses.

### IP Addressing (Static vs Dynamic)

- *Static IP*: A fixed IP address assigned to a device.
- *Dynamic IP*: An IP address assigned temporarily by a DHCP server.
